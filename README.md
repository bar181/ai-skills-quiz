## What Is This?

The **AI Professional Maturity Framework** is a 12-level self-assessment tool that maps how deeply artificial intelligence has changed — or hasn't changed — the way you actually work.

AI adoption isn't a yes-or-no question. There's a wide spectrum between "I've tried ChatGPT" and "my 10-person team produces the output of 100." This framework captures every meaningful stage in between, with behavioral descriptions, psychological profiles, and organizational context at each level — so you can locate yourself accurately, not aspirationally.

Built for **non-technical professionals** across every function: marketing, finance, operations, HR, legal, consulting, and leadership.

## The 12 Levels at a Glance

| Level | Name | TL;DR |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **The Skeptic** | Not for me. I'll wait and see. |
| 1 | **The Tourist** | I tried it. It was fine. Then I forgot about it. |
| 2 | **The Copy/Paste Professional** | AI writes my first drafts. I still do the thinking. |
| 3 | **The Prompt Tinkerer** | I have a prompts doc. Context is everything. |
| 4 | **The Conversationalist** | I talk to AI like a smart intern, not a vending machine. |
| 5 | **The Multi-Tool Professional** | Right AI, right job. I never read anything without summarising it first. |
| 6 | **The Workflow Designer** | I've decomposed my job into tasks. Most of them have an AI layer now. |
| 7 | **The Persona Architect** | My AI outputs don't sound like AI. Every audience gets exactly what they need. |
| 8 | **The Vendor Threat** | I can build what you're selling before the meeting ends. |
| 9 | **The Technical Non-Coder** | My team ships code. None of them have CS degrees. |
| 10 | **The Org Redesigner** | I'm not using AI to work faster. I'm using it to need fewer people for the same output. |
| 11 | **The AI-Native Operator** | 10 people. Unicorn output. AI isn't a tool — it's the org chart. |

## What Makes This Framework Different

Most AI maturity models describe **what tools you use**. This one describes **who you are** at each stage.

Every level includes four components:

- **Description** — the behavioral reality of operating at this level
- **The Person** — a psychological portrait: what drives them, what's holding them back, what unlocks the next level
- **The Company** — what the organisation around them looks like at this stage
- **The Unlock** — the single specific shift that moves someone to the next level

The **Person** and **Company** sections are what make this framework sticky. Learners don't just read a description of behaviours — they recognise themselves, their colleagues, and their organisation. That recognition is what drives change.

---

## Core Philosophy

Three principles run through every level of this framework:

**1. AI handles tasks. Humans handle responsibility.**
No autonomous AI for client-facing decisions. No delegating accountability to a machine. Human oversight isn't a limitation — it's the design.

**2. Conversation beats prompting.**
AI performs best when managed like a smart intern: confirm understanding before execution, iterate through dialogue, and treat vague inputs as your problem — not the tool's.

**3. The goal isn't to use AI more. It's to redesign what work is.**
The professionals and organisations at the top of this framework aren't more productive at the same job. They've changed the job entirely.

## How to Use This Framework

### For Individual Self-Assessment
Read each level description and locate yourself honestly — not aspirationally. The Person section is the most accurate mirror. If it describes someone you recognise, that's your level.

### For Team Capability Discussions
Use the Company descriptions to identify where your organisation is, independently of where individuals are. A Level 5 person in a Level 2 company hits a ceiling quickly. Naming the gap is the first step to closing it.

### For Training and Workshops
The framework is structured for progressive delivery — each level builds on the last. The Unlock line at each level works as a session hook: *"here's the one thing that moves you from where you are to the next stage."*

### For Leadership Strategy
The distribution data (above) contextualises your team. If your organisation sits at the L2–L3 average, you're in the majority — but the gap between L3 and L6 is where competitive advantage is currently being built.
